Extension Manual
================

This is a template manual aiming to help developers when it comes to documentation.
The template provides a structure that a developer can use and
many useful snippets and examples. Documentation is written in reST format.

You manual may be comprised of the whole `Documentation` folder
or just of this README file. More information about the structure
of the files can be found in `Directory and File Names`_ in "Writing
Documentation" and `Adding Documentation`_ in "TYPO3 Explained".

Even if your documentation resides in the `Documentation` folder, it
still makes sense to add a README.rst if your project is hosted on GitHub,
where the contents of the README.rst will be displayed by default.

For further information about writing TYPO3 documentation, please see
`Writing Documentation`_ and specifically in that manual
`Writing Documentation for an Extension`_.

If you find any problems in this sample manual, please add an `Issue`_,
or contact the documentation team via Slack or Email (see `Help & Support`_).

Remember: documentation is like gift wrapping, it may look superfluous,
but your friends tend to be rather disappointed when their presents
arrive in supermarket carrier bags. (Documentation-Driven Design quote)
